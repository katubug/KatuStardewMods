Hi!! I love this mod so much! It is by far my favorite Stardew Valley mod! The farm is so cozy and fun to explore!! But I can't help but notice that the "starting gifts" are a little unbalanced...
The rancher starting gift is almost pointless only helping you with one item for the community center and giving you hay... Which does not help because you don't have a coop with chickens (like the meadowlands farm).
The fisherman one is also bad... Because it only just gives you a 1 day advantage to fish...   (It does not save much money-) and some trout soup wich does not compare to the advantage those parsnip seeds give you if you choose the farming gift...
Overall i think that the farming gift is the best one generally and it does not compare to the other gifts because of the sheer amount of extra money it generates...
I have a few suggestions ^-^ I just got bored so I wrote a few down (you don't need to take the seriously but I would love if you consdiered them):
You could make all of them fun or you could nerf the farming gift. I would love if you had a set of gifts for challenging runs and another set for those runs you kind of want to skip the early game:
(I will mark the gifts for the challenging runs with a C and for the casual runs with a S)
Farmer S: 5 parsnip seeds; 2 sprinklers; 5 quality fertelizer; 7 mixed seeds; 1 scarecrow; 1 apple tree (this allows a fun farming-focused early-game while giving a late-game investment) 
Farmer C: 8 parsnip seeds, 1 chest (replacing the  flashy scarecrow and sprinklers) , 10 sap (wich helps you craft fertelizer)
Florist S: 3 beehives; 5  jazz seeds; 5 tulip seeds; 5 fairy rose seeds; 13 mixed flower seeds; 1 scarecrow; 1 dried sunflower, 1 sprinkler, 10 rustic pathways (this allows a fun and colorfull flower-focued early game; floweres have barely any profit so that is the reason they are so many; the beehive helps with the income and you have a late-game investment, and has some decoration elements to help you fit into the flowerly vibe) 
Florist C: 2 beehives, 18 mixed flower seeds, 1 dried sunflower (you have less control of your floweres and make way less income)
Forager S: 1 copper hoe, 10 spring forage seeds, 5 pancakes, 10 clay, 2 mushroom logs, 20 moss, 6 tents, 5 wild plums (you have early-forage important materials, the copper hoe helps you a bit to clay-farm both in early and in late game, the tent helps you have an unique early game; this might be a little overpowered maybe don't give the copper hoe or give less tents) 
Forager C: 3 tents; 5 common mushrooms, 1 mushroom log, 10 moss, 2 clay, 2 pancakes, 1 leek, 1 horseraddish, 1 daffodil, 3 carrot seeds
Fisher S: 1 fiberglass rod, 3 crab pots, 25 deluxe bait, 1 straw hat, 10 bream bait, 30 crap bait, 1 recycle machine (you skip a fishing pole tier, but fish will be way harder to catch, you might use the bait to catch fish easier, but that won't last for long an eventually you will have a bait shortage untill you level up fishing; the player will be forced to catch fish while the bar size is small, having an easy early-game and a hard mid-game ) 
Fisher C: 1 fiberglass rod, 2 crab pots, 20 bait, 1 straw hat, 25 catfish bait, 10 bream bait (less bait for easier fish, only fishing experts will benefit with the catfish bait)
Rancher S: 1 auto-grab, 370 wood, 120 stone, 20 hay, 10 carrot seeds, 30 hay pathwats, 2 torches, 10 decorative hay, 2 decorative lamps, 1earth crystal  (perfect decrorations for a true rancher, enough materials for a coop and a chest, a fun auto-grab to make ranching more fun; provided some materials for a mayo machine; The early game and late game will be super fun for you and your animal buddies,  the carrots will make you some money for the chickens)
Rancher C: 185 wood, 80 stone, 5 hay, 4 carrot seeds, 30 hay pathwys, 2 torches, 10 decorative hay, 2 decorative lamps, 1 earth crystal 
Wow... I got carried away... I hope you enjoy the suggestions and sorry for the typos

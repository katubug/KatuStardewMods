my uniqueid if you wanted it: Aviroen.Edelweiss
loved:
"The Egg": "This isn't one of Rasmodius' strange raw lizard eggs is it?$7#$b# Oh just a normal Ostrich egg?$4#$b# Thank Yoba!$10"
/ tbh all fish dishes if you want me to do specific dialogues for each then ok i'll do that later

//i don't know lore around this one
"Unknowable Dish": "This is definitely one of Rasmodius' strange concoctions isn't it?$5"


tiakall â€” Today at 4:41 PM
Baked Void Salmon: like for Jorts ("Wow, this is a scrungy fish!), neutral for Jean ("Um... @, where did you get this fish...?$4")
Heavy Cream: love for both
Salmon Fillet: love for both
Smoked Salmon Bagel: like for both (Jorts: "This is tasty!  The plate is kind of weird, though.$3" / Jean: "This salmon paste is quite nice. You can keep the bagel, though.$6"

Sadly lemon and most of the other ingredients are toxic ðŸ˜¦
(Their internal names are JortsCat and JeanCat, you'll need to use that for their gift tastes)

I think I mention it in my NPC tutorial, give me a sec
Wren (internal name WrenSong) loves mushrooms so you can add these to her loves:

Beer Braised Mushrooms
Curried Mushroom Skewers
Mushroom Crepes
Mushroom Stroganoff

She dislikes anything that's excessively greasy or salty (she has to watch her weight since she's older)
aha  In regards to gifting, 1.6 adds a new feature: rejecting gifts. Simply add a dialogue key for the item using reject_(O)ItemNameOrNumber (e.g., reject_(O)196 or reject_(O)tiakall.bass.seabass). This bypasses the gift tastes completely, so there's no friendship gain/loss. 
for gift rejections, you could have Jorts say "Sorry, Jean says I can't have this. It smells nice though!" and Jean can say "@, I can't eat this. Perhaps you could give it to a human instead?"
Oh, Wren also dislikes salads :SDVpuffersquee:
